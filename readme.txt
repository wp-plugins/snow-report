<h3>Catch some powder on your website with a snow report!</h3>

Display the snow conditions on your favorite mountain or in your area using the Snow Report plugin. Choose to display a resort's open status, snow base depth, 48 hour snowfall, surface conditions, and link to purchase lift tickets.

= Using the `[snow_report]` Shortcode =
If you're a maniac for shortcodes, and you want all control all the time, this is a good way to use it.

<strong>The shortcode supports the following settings:</strong>

* `location="Colorado"` - It must exactly match one of the "Report Location" drop-down options on the left
* `caption="Ski Reports for Colorado"` - Add a caption to your table (it's like a title) 
* `measurement='inches'` - Use either `inches` or `cm`
* `align='center'` - Align the table cells. Choose from `left`, `center`, or `right`
* `noresults="Snow reports aren&rsquo;t available right now."` - Message shown when no results are available
* `show_tickets="yes"` - Show a link to purchase lift tickets for each displayed resort (`yes` or `no`)
* `cache_results="yes"` - Whether to cache results or not. Setting this to "no" is not encouraged. (`yes` or `no`)
* `ticket_text="%%resort%% lift tickets"` - Format the text for the buy tickets link. `%%resort%%` will be replaced by the resort name.
* `showclosed="yes"` - Show seasonally closed mountains (`yes` or `no`)
* `class="css_table_class"` - Change the CSS class of the generated report table
* `showtablelink="yes"` - Show a link under the snow report table that lets people know this plugin was used
* `id="1"` - If you are showing more than one snow report for the same location on a page, use `&lt;id&gt;` and give them unique ID numbers. Otherwise, they will be identical (if caching is turned on).
* `columns="status,base,48hr,surface,tickets"` - The columns that will be shown in the table. <br /><strong>How to define shown columns:</strong>
	* Show only if a resort is open: `columns="status"`.
	* Show base pack and lift tickets: `columns="base,tickets"`.
	* Show 48 hour snowfall and surface conditions: `columns="48hr,surface"`.

= I want to modify the snow report output. How do I do that? =

<pre>
function replace_snow_data($content) {
	// This will make all fields with "N/A" blank instead
	$content = str_replace('N/A', '', $content);
	return $content;
}
add_filter('snow_report_output', 'replace_snow_data');
</pre>

= What is the plugin license? =

* This plugin is released under a GPL license.

= This plugin slows down my site. =
Version 1.1 added caching functionality. To enable, go to the options page and check the box next to "Cache Results." If that doesn't work as expected, it is recommended to use a caching plugin (such as WP Super Cache) so that the report isn't re-generated each page load.


= How do I have two snow reports of the same location on the same page? =
If you're going to have two reports for the same area on the same page, you should add the `id` attribute to your shortcode:
`[snow_report location="Colorado" id="1" caption="Test 1"] is now different from [snow_report location="Colorado" id="2" caption="Test 2"]`

This way, the caching functionality will display different results.

__Note:__ This is only an issue when caching is turned on.
